= Overview of Testing the API with a POST request =
A script `exampleCURL_21d23.sh` is included for reference to enable testing of a local development environment.  

= Executing test script =
To execute the script, from a bash shell enter `./exampleCURL_21d23.sh`, the server should respond with the current time in epoch:

`api       |
